# Design Theory and Algebra

## Overview
A library for reasoning on algebraic techniques for problems in design and hypergraph theory. 

## Algebra and Designs

Algebra plays a significant role in combinatorics, with multiple proof techniques employing a number of algebraic representations/techniques that are not always immediately obvious. In particular - this repository focuses on techniques from linear algebra and group theory
